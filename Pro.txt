Act as a Product Manager at UBS preparing a hackathon pitch for senior leadership.

Create a professional PowerPoint presentation (maximum 4–5 slides) for the following solution under the theme:

"Improving software delivery productivity by identifying and resolving lifecycle bottlenecks using Automation, AI, or GHCP with measurable outcomes and reusable solutions."

PROJECT OVERVIEW:

We have built an AI-powered productivity layer plugin that can be seamlessly integrated with engineering workflow platforms such as GitLab (currently implemented), and can be extended to Confluence and SharePoint.

The solution provides a personal productivity layer to engineers to track and manage:
- GitLab Issues they are working on
- Personal daily objectives and achievements
- Project knowledge base (via Wiki Sync)

The system integrates with GitLab APIs to:
- Import issues
- Track issue progress
- Update GitLab issues directly
- Create or modify GitLab issues using AI-generated descriptions
- Sync updates without requiring duplicate effort across tools

The solution includes an AI-powered Issue Assistant where users can:
- Summarize GitLab issues
- Ask contextual queries about the issue
- Generate improved descriptions
- Break down complex issues into actionable steps
- Update GitLab tickets using LLM-powered assistance

This helps reduce requirement ambiguity and documentation dependency during execution.

BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION:

The system identifies delivery lifecycle bottlenecks at an individual contributor level such as:
- Issue idle time (task stuck in progress)
- Frequent reassignment (ownership confusion)
- Reopened issues (requirement ambiguity)
- Multitasking overload (too many parallel issues)
- Context switching delays
- Documentation search overhead

BOTTLENECK RESOLUTION FEATURES:

Focus Mode:
Allows user to select a single issue and lock the working interface for a defined duration.
This reduces multitasking and context switching and encourages focused execution of one issue at a time.

Personal Tracker:
Allows users to track daily objectives and achievements.
Helps streamline daily status updates and reduces reporting overhead.

Knowledge Sync (RAG-based):
Project Wikis are pulled from GitLab and stored in a centralized knowledge base using RAG.
Helps new members onboard faster and reduces knowledge discovery time.

Neuro-Adaptive Accessibility Mode:
Includes dyslexic-friendly interface by enabling Open Dyslexic font and increased word spacing.
Adaptive execution model inspired by neurodivergent productivity patterns such as task chunking to reduce cognitive overload.

QUANTIFIABLE IMPROVEMENT METRICS (Based on Prototype Simulation):

- Up to 30–40% reduction in issue idle time
- Reduced issue reassignment rate
- Reduced issue reopen rate
- Reduced multitasking overhead
- Faster issue understanding via AI summarization
- Reduced duplication of updates across tools

REUSABLE & SCALABLE DESIGN:

- Plugin-based architecture
- GitLab API abstraction layer
- Extendable to Confluence / SharePoint
- Modular AI services
- RAG-based knowledge sync
- Suitable for deployment across multiple engineering teams

STRUCTURE THE SLIDES AS FOLLOWS:

Slide 1 – Problem Statement & Lifecycle Bottlenecks
Slide 2 – Proposed Solution (AI Productivity Plugin Layer)
Slide 3 – Key Features & AI Capabilities
Slide 4 – Measurable Impact & Bottleneck Reduction
Slide 5 – Reusable & Scalable Architecture

Ensure:
- Bullet points only
- Concise executive-level language
- Emphasis on delivery productivity
- Avoid long paragraphs
- Focus on project delivery improvement, not just personal productivity
