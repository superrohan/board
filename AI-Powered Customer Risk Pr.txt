Project: AI-Powered Customer Risk Profiling Engine (CRPE)

Overview:
The Customer Risk Profiling Engine (CRPE) is a microservice-based application designed to analyze customer transaction data and generate dynamic risk scores for internal fraud monitoring systems.

The system ingests transactional and profile data from multiple upstream banking systems and applies rule-based and ML-assisted scoring logic to classify customers into Low, Medium, or High-risk categories.

The generated risk profile is consumed by:
- Fraud Monitoring Dashboard
- Transaction Authorization Engine
- Compliance Monitoring Service

CRPE is expected to support near real-time scoring with latency below 300ms per request and should be horizontally scalable to support peak loads during trading hours.

Architecture Components:

1. Data Ingestion Layer
Consumes customer data from Kafka topics.
Validates schema and filters incomplete payloads.

2. Risk Scoring Service
Applies business rules such as:
- High-value international transactions
- Sudden transaction pattern deviation
- Blacklisted geolocation

Integrates ML-based anomaly detection model.

3. Profile Aggregator
Aggregates transaction signals across rolling 30-day windows.

4. Risk Classification Engine
Converts risk score into risk band:
Low (0–40)
Medium (41–70)
High (71–100)

5. API Gateway
Exposes REST endpoint:
/risk/score

Functional Requirements:

- System should update risk score within 5 minutes of transaction ingestion.
- Risk score calculation should be idempotent.
- API must support 1000 concurrent requests.
- Risk profile should be persisted in PostgreSQL.
- Risk score recalculation must be triggered if profile attributes change.

Known Constraints:

- Kafka ingestion may be delayed during peak load.
- ML model inference latency varies between 50–120ms.
- Risk recalculation logic is dependent on upstream profile sync service.
- Documentation for anomaly scoring thresholds is incomplete.
